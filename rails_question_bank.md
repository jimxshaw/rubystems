How do you create a Rails application called MyApp from the command line with a MySQL database?
- rails new my_app -d mysql

What's the shorthand for `rails generate`?
- rails g

You use singular PascalCase for Model generation.
- True, eg `rails generate model MyModel`

How do you add attributes and their datatype in Rails generate?
- rails generate model Product name:string

What option flag do you use to omit automatic timestamp attributes?
- rails generate model Product --no-timestamps

How do you autopopulate the migration change method?
- rails generate migration Add[something]To[SomeModel] qty_sold:integer

How do you add an index in the migration generation?
- rails generate migration Add[Attribute]To[SomeModel] <attr>:<type>:index
  
How do you add a foreign key in migration generation?
- rails generate migration Add[Attribute]To[SomeModel] <attr>:references
  
Generating a model creates four file types. What are they?
- Model, migration, model test, model fixture

Running `rails generate migration AddQtySoldToProducts qty_sold:integer` will create what single line of code in the #change method?
- add_column :products, :qty_sold, :integer ***
- add_column :qty_sold, :products, :integer
- add_column :products, qty_sold: :integer

On a generation command, what additional line of code is produced in your migration file when running `rails generate migration AddRefNumToProducts ref_num:string:index`?
- add_index :products, :ref_num

What single line of code is produced in your migration's #change method when running `rails generate migration AddStyleToProducts style:references`
- add_reference :products, :style, foreign_key: true

Before Rails version X.y.z, the same migration above would produce what code instead of the newer `add_reference`?
- don't know; need to look up

At what version did Rails introduce the #change method as the autogenerated code in migration files?
- dunno, need to look up

What methods are supported by the #change method?
- create_table, add_column, add_index, add_foreign_key, add_reference, add_timestamps
- also has: rename_table, rename_column, and rename_index
- also has: drop_table, remove_column, remove_index, remove_foreign_key, remove_reference, remove_timestamps

Which two methods require more info in #change to be reversible?
- drop_table and remove_column

Why wont this code work? `def change; remove_column :products, :qty_sold; end`
- running `rails db:migrate` won't know what datatype to put on the column when effectively migrating "up"

In a reversible code block, what is the conventional block variable?
- dir, as in reversible do |dir|; dir.up {}; dir.down{}; end;

Running `rails db:migrate` is just shorthand for what command?
- `rails db:migrate:up VERSION=[migration_id]`

Given the following output after running `rails db:migrate:status`:

| Status |  Migration ID   | Migration Name
| ------ | --------------- | -----------------------
|   up   |  20170918051411 | Create products
|   up   |  20170918051840 | Add qty sold to products
|   up   |  20170918052339 | Add ref num to products
|   up   |  20170918052723 | Add style to products
|  down  |  20170918061514 | Create styles
|  down  |  20170918061614 | Add foreign key to products

(cont'd from above), how would you only run the "Create styles" migration?
- `rails db:migrate:up VERSION=20170918061514`

How would you migrate down incrementally one migration_id at a time? Take the same table above, for example. What command could you use instead of `rails db:migrate:down VERSION=20170918052723`?
- `rails db:rollback`

How would you generate a migration to revert "Add style to products"?
- `rails generate migration RevertAddStyleToProducts`

There are two lines of code required in the revert migration file, one outside the migration class, and one inside the #change method. What would they be for the migration you just generated?
- `require_relative '20170918052723_add_style_to_products'` and `revert AddStyleToProducts`

In what Rails version did the shortcut `CreateJoinTable<TableA><TableB>` come into existence?
- dunno, look up

What's the full Rails generation for creating an inner join table migration?
- `rails generate migration CreateJoinTableTableATableB table_a table_b`

How can you suppress terminal output when running a migration?
- `rails db:migrate VERBOSE=false`

Which command looks at the database and dumps it into Ruby format for you to see?
- `rails db:schema:dump`

How would you load from the database into Rails the database schema in the SQL lang?
- `rails db:structure:dump`

What file is created from structure dump?
- `structure.sql`

If you manually delete your schema.rb file, which two commands will regenerate it?
- `rails db:migrate` and `rails db:schema:dump`

What command loads your sample data into your database?
- `rails db:seed`
