# Rails Question Bank

## Rails Command Line

How do you create a Rails application called MyApp from the command line with a MySQL database?
- rails new my_app -d mysql

What's the shorthand for `rails generate`?
- rails g

You use singular PascalCase for Model generation.
- True, eg `rails generate model MyModel`

How do you add attributes and their datatype in Rails generate?
- rails generate model Product name:string

What option flag do you use to omit automatic timestamp attributes?
- rails generate model Product --no-timestamps

How do you autopopulate the migration change method?
- rails generate migration Add[something]To[SomeModel] qty_sold:integer

How do you add an index in the migration generation?
- rails generate migration Add[Attribute]To[SomeModel] <attr>:<type>:index
  
How do you add a foreign key in migration generation?
- rails generate migration Add[Attribute]To[SomeModel] <attr>:references
  
Generating a model creates four file types. What are they?
- Model, migration, model test, model fixture

Running `rails generate migration AddQtySoldToProducts qty_sold:integer` will create what single line of code in the #change method?
- add_column :products, :qty_sold, :integer ***
- add_column :qty_sold, :products, :integer
- add_column :products, qty_sold: :integer

On a generation command, what additional line of code is produced in your migration file when running `rails generate migration AddRefNumToProducts ref_num:string:index`?
- add_index :products, :ref_num

What single line of code is produced in your migration's #change method when running `rails generate migration AddStyleToProducts style:references`
- add_reference :products, :style, foreign_key: true

Before Rails version X.y.z, the same migration above would produce what code instead of the newer `add_reference`?
- don't know; need to look up

At what version did Rails introduce the #change method as the autogenerated code in migration files?
- dunno, need to look up

What methods are supported by the #change method?
- create_table, add_column, add_index, add_foreign_key, add_reference, add_timestamps
- also has: rename_table, rename_column, and rename_index
- also has: drop_table, remove_column, remove_index, remove_foreign_key, remove_reference, remove_timestamps

Which two methods require more info in #change to be reversible?
- drop_table and remove_column

Why wont this code work? `def change; remove_column :products, :qty_sold; end`
- running `rails db:migrate` won't know what datatype to put on the column when effectively migrating "up"

In a reversible code block, what is the conventional block variable?
- dir, as in reversible do |dir|; dir.up {}; dir.down{}; end;

Running `rails db:migrate` is just shorthand for what command?
- `rails db:migrate:up VERSION=[migration_id]`

Given the following output after running `rails db:migrate:status`:

| Status |  Migration ID   | Migration Name
| ------ | --------------- | -----------------------
|   up   |  20170918051411 | Create products
|   up   |  20170918051840 | Add qty sold to products
|   up   |  20170918052339 | Add ref num to products
|   up   |  20170918052723 | Add style to products
|  down  |  20170918061514 | Create styles
|  down  |  20170918061614 | Add foreign key to products

(cont'd from above), how would you only run the "Create styles" migration?
- `rails db:migrate:up VERSION=20170918061514`

How would you migrate down incrementally one migration_id at a time? Take the same table above, for example. What command could you use instead of `rails db:migrate:down VERSION=20170918052723`?
- `rails db:rollback`

How would you generate a migration to revert "Add style to products"?
- `rails generate migration RevertAddStyleToProducts`

There are two lines of code required in the revert migration file, one outside the migration class, and one inside the #change method. What would they be for the migration you just generated?
- `require_relative '20170918052723_add_style_to_products'` and `revert AddStyleToProducts`

In what Rails version did the shortcut `CreateJoinTable<TableA><TableB>` come into existence?
- dunno, look up

What's the full Rails generation for creating an inner join table migration?
- `rails generate migration CreateJoinTableTableATableB table_a table_b`

How can you suppress terminal output when running a migration?
- `rails db:migrate VERBOSE=false`

Which command looks at the database and dumps it into Ruby format for you to see?
- `rails db:schema:dump`

How would you load from the database into Rails the database schema in the SQL lang?
- `rails db:structure:dump`

What file is created from structure dump?
- `structure.sql`

If you manually delete your schema.rb file, which two commands will regenerate it?
- `rails db:migrate` and `rails db:schema:dump`

What command loads your sample data into your database?
- `rails db:seed`

## Rails CRUD

What's the alias for `#update_attribute()` and `#update_attributes()`?
- `#update`

How would you set attr values line by line?
- `product.attr = "value"`

How would you set attr values via hash?
- `product = Product.new(attr: "value", attr2: "value"); product.save`

How would you set attr values via block?
  ```ruby
  product = Product.create do |p|
    p.attr = "value"
    p.attr2 = "value"
  end
  ```

The `#update_attribute` method uses comma notation, right?
- `product.update_attribute(:attr, "value")`

The `#update_attributes` method uses hash notation, right?
- `product.update_attributes(attr: "value")`

What's the best way to update all attrs in a table?
- Use the `.update_all()` class method, like `Product.update_all(attr: "value")`

True or false: class methods will still run callbacks and validations.
- False

What is the best method to remove a record from the database?
- `product.destroy`

What's the difference between `#destroy` instance method and the `.destroy` class method?
- `.destroy` is called against the model class, eg `Product.destroy([:id])`

What method will destroy all records?
- `Product.destroy_all`

What's the difference between `.destroy` and `.delete`?
- `.delete` doesn't run callbacks or validations. Just executes SQL.

How do you manually update a record's "updated_at" value?
- `@product.touch`; useful for child objects, like upload an image and touch the associated record; good for callbacks

What is the default attribute that `product.touch` will update?
- updated_at

How would you `touch` a different attribute?
- `product.touch(:attr)`

How do you toggle a boolean attribute?
- `product.toggle(:attr)`

Does `#toggle` persist changes to the database?
- False

How would you persist a toggle?
- `product.toggle!(:attr)`

How would you increment an attribute of type integer? Instead of @p.attr = @p.attr + 1
- `@p.increment(:attr, 1)` or leave off the 1 for default "by 1"

How would you increment and persist to database?
- Use the bang notation.

What's the opposite of `#increment`?
- `@p.decrement(:attr)`

Should you use #increment and #decrement for associated objects?
- False

What should you use instead for associated objects?
- Cache counter
